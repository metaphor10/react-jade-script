# React Jade Generator script

VERY VERY experimental just trying stuff out

you need to have node npm and node-express-genrator installed.

run the script . generate_jade_sever.sh <app name>

and then after it completes run npm install

to run the project you need to first erase main.js and then run gulp browser

finally have the layout jade file use the main.js as a script.
